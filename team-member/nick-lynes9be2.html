                    <p>My background in e-gaming took me all over the world and provided me with many incredible experiences.  Flawless however, is turning out to be something that surpasses all of those.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a lifelong film fan and at heart I feel like more of a creative than a &#8220;business leader&#8221;. I met Scott through a personal creative journey and that led to the formation of Flawless. Scott had already produced the first visual translation demo and when he showed me I realised that GenAI represented a fundamental augmentation for the global creative industries.  </p>
<p>I like risky, exciting and almost impossible projects. I don&#8217;t tend to consider &#8216;what if it doesn&#8217;t work?&#8217;, If I did I&#8217;d never have had these amazing experiences that I am so lucky to have had and sometimes you just need to commit to success. </p>
<p>The AI based tools we have developed, whether its TrueSync, producing perfectly lip-synced films or DeepEditor, helping filmmakers create without compromise, are changing how we express our individual creativity.  </p>
<p>But we are working in a challenging field &#8211; both technically and ethically.  AI can&#8217;t assess itself critically and iterate towards a better, more creative or productive output. However, humans using AI can and they must. In reality, we&#8217;re going to need more creators not less and their value is going to skyrocket. </p>
<p>So if you like a challenge, step on board!</p>
